# Segmentation and Classification of Medical Images with U-Net in PyTorch

## Overview

This project focuses on the **segmentation** and **classification** of medical images, specifically targeting skin diseases. The objective is to develop a web-based application where users can upload medical images, receive a segmented output highlighting relevant features, and get a classification of the detected disease along with potential recommendations. The U-Net architecture is implemented using **PyTorch** for image segmentation, followed by a feature detection and classification pipeline.

## Dataset

The project uses three main datasets:

1. **Segmentation Dataset**: Contains medical images of skin anomalies and their corresponding segmentation masks.
2. **Feature Detection Dataset**: Contains binary masks for specific characteristics/features of the skin conditions.
3. **Classification Dataset**: Contains images with disease labels for training the classification model.

You can find more details on the datasets [here](link-to-dataset).

## Model Architecture

### U-Net Architecture

The **U-Net** architecture is a convolutional neural network designed for biomedical image segmentation. It consists of an encoder that captures the context and a symmetric decoder that enables precise localization.

- **Encoder**: Downsampling via convolutional layers with pooling operations.
- **Decoder**: Upsampling with skip connections from the encoder layers to preserve fine-grained details.
- **Final Layer**: A 1x1 convolution to reduce the number of channels to the required number of classes for segmentation.

### Segmentation Pipeline

1. Pre-process input images.
2. Apply the U-Net model to generate segmentation masks.
3. Post-process the segmented output to refine the results.

### Classification Pipeline

1. Extract features from the segmented image.
2. Apply a classification model to predict the disease type.
3. Provide diagnosis and potential recommendations based on the classification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-image-segmentation-classification.git
   cd medical-image-segmentation-classification
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the datasets and place them in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

### Training the Model

You can train the U-Net model for segmentation by running the following command:

```bash
python src/train.py --config config.yaml
```

### Running Inference

To segment a new medical image, run:

```bash
python src/inference.py --image path_to_image --model models/unet.pth
```

For classification, after the segmentation step, you can use the extracted features to predict the disease:

```bash
python src/classify.py --segmentation path_to_segmented_image --model models/classifier.pth
```

### Web Application

You can launch the web app for users to upload their images, get segmentation and classification results:

```bash
python app/app.py
```

The web app will be available at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## Results

- **Segmentation Performance**: [Add metrics such as Dice Coefficient, IoU, etc.]
- **Classification Performance**: [Add metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.]
- [Include sample images showing segmentation and classification results] (in progress)

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Tuning**: Further fine-tune the U-Net model to improve segmentation accuracy.
2. **Multi-Class Classification**: Extend classification to support multi-class skin diseases.
3. **Web App Features**: Add more features to the web interface, such as image enhancement and side-by-side comparison of original and segmented images.
